# 2-D Basketball Game
# About:

This is a Two-Dimensional Basketball Game built completely using python and its modules along with MySQL as the backend software. The game has two major components which are 1) Selecting the Players(Done using a Tkinter GUI) and 2) The Game (Pygame). It also has additional features like a music section where you can choose among 20 songs from our selected mix of songs, a leaderboard for all players to see the highest scoring players and a way to review the results of your last 5 games and the score distribution for the current game. After every game the users can switch their teams and mix up different play styles from a total of 12 players at each of the 5 positions. The scoring,passing and defense work on basic principles of probability and consider a variety of factors to determine success and failure. To aid the user, every necessary detail is on the game page.
