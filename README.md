# 2-D Basketball Game
The game has two main sections, the first is the player selection/draft which works with a Tkinter GUI and the second being the actual game which runs using Pygame.
The necessary images, music files and other data can be downloaded by cloning the repository, to start the game you can run the Final.py file from the Pygame/ folder.
